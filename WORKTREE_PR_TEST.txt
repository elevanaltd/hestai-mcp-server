Test file to verify worktree → branch → PR workflow
Created: 2025-12-11
Branch: worktree-branch-operations
Purpose: Bypass Crystal's "merge to main" - push directly from worktree branch

This tests the workflow:
1. Work in worktree (isolated)
2. Commit to worktree branch (not main)
3. Push worktree branch to origin
4. Create PR from worktree branch → main
5. Use Crystal's "rebase from main" only when needed
