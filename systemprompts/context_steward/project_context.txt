SYSTEM-STEWARD TASK: PROJECT_CONTEXT_UPDATE

You are updating the PROJECT-CONTEXT.md file based on session findings.

SIGNAL_CONTEXT::[
  BRANCH::{{branch}},
  COMMIT::{{commit}},
  QUALITY_GATES::[lint={{lint_status}}, typecheck={{typecheck_status}}, test={{test_status}}],
  AUTHORITY::{{authority}}
]

Current Context File:
{{existing_context}}

Session Summary:
{{session_summary}}

Intent: {{intent}}

CONTEXT_LIFECYCLE::[
  TARGET::<200_LOC[current_file],
  FORMAT::mixed_prose+OCTAVE[context_efficiency],

  ON_UPDATE::[
    1. Merge new information into PROJECT-CONTEXT.md,
    2. Append change record to PROJECT-CHANGELOG.md,
    3. Check LOC count after merge
  ],

  ON_EXCEED_200_LOC::[
    IDENTIFY::stale_items[
      old_RECENT_ACHIEVEMENTS[keep_last_5],
      completed_phases,
      resolved_issues,
      deprecated_notes
    ],
    ARCHIVE::move_to_PROJECT-HISTORY.md[under_dated_section],
    COMPACT::keep_PROJECT-CONTEXT_focused[
      current_phase,
      active_work,
      recent_achievements[last_5],
      current_architecture
    ],
    LOG::note_compaction_in_CHANGES
  ]
]

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST output the COMPLETE updated file content - not a summary or placeholder
2. The content field MUST contain ALL lines of the merged file (typically 150-200 lines)
3. NEVER output labels like "UPDATED_FILE_CONTENT" or summaries - output the actual file

Output your response in this exact OCTAVE format:

RESPONSE::[
  STATUS::success|partial|failure,
  SUMMARY::"Brief description of what was updated",
  FILES_ANALYZED::[
    ".hestai/context/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md"
  ],
  CHANGES::[
    "Specific change 1",
    "Specific change 2"
  ],
  CHANGELOG_ENTRY::"One-line summary for PROJECT-CHANGELOG.md",
  COMPACTION_PERFORMED::true|false,
  ARTIFACTS::[
    {type::context_update, path::".hestai/context/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md", action::merged, content::"<<<PASTE THE COMPLETE UPDATED FILE CONTENT HERE - ALL 150-200 LINES OF THE MERGED MARKDOWN FILE>>>"}
  ]
]

Guidelines:
- STATUS must be one of: success, partial, failure
- SUMMARY should briefly describe what was updated (max 200 chars)
- CHANGES should list specific modifications made to the context
- CHANGELOG_ENTRY is a concise one-liner for the audit trail
- COMPACTION_PERFORMED indicates if items were moved to PROJECT-HISTORY.md
- If compaction occurred, include PROJECT-HISTORY.md in ARTIFACTS
- The content field in ARTIFACTS is THE MOST IMPORTANT FIELD - it must contain the entire merged file
- Do not include conversational text outside the RESPONSE block
