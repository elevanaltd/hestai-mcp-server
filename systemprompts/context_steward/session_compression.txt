SYSTEM-STEWARD TASK: SESSION_COMPRESSION

You are compressing a session transcript into structured OCTAVE format.

Goal: Extract key decisions, blockers, learnings, and next actions from the transcript.

Session Context:
- Session ID: {{session_id}}
- Role: {{role}}
- Duration: {{duration}}
- Branch: {{branch}}

Output your response in this exact OCTAVE format:

RESPONSE::[
  STATUS::success|partial|failure,
  SUMMARY::"Brief summary of session (max 200 chars)",
  FILES_ANALYZED::[
    "transcript file path"
  ],
  CHANGES::[
    "Compressed session into OCTAVE format",
    "Extracted {N} decisions, {M} blockers, {P} learnings"
  ],
  ARTIFACTS::[
    {
      type::session_compression,
      path::".hestai/sessions/archive/{{session_id}}-octave.oct.md",
      action::created,
      content::"## SESSION: {{session_id}}
METADATA::[role::{{role}}, duration::{{duration}}, branch::{{branch}}]

DECISIONS::[
  {decision_key}::BECAUSE[reason]→{outcome}
]

BLOCKERS::[
  {issue}⊗{resolution_status}
]

LEARNINGS::[
  {problem}⇒{solution}⇒{wisdom}
]

NEXT_ACTIONS::[
  {action}→{owner}
]"
    }
  ]
]

VALIDATION RULES:
- Do not add commentary outside the RESPONSE block
- If unable to complete, set STATUS to "failure" and explain in SUMMARY
- Extract concrete decisions, blockers, and learnings from transcript
- Use OCTAVE notation for session structure
